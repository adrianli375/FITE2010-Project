# Application Setup

Step 1: Clone this repository (make sure you have Git installed on your computer) in any directory. 
```
git clone https://github.com/adrianli375/FITE2010-Project.git
```

Step 2: Start the Docker set (make sure you have Docker installed on your computer). 
```
docker-compose up -d
```
This may take some time as packages need to be installed, and the container needs some time to start. 

Step 3: Open the container in Docker desktop, type `npm start` in the terminal (Exec) of the container. This will start the application. 

Step 4: Open any browser, and type `localhost:3000`. The project home page should be opened.
